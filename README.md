A malicious file detection engine written with Python and Yara.


* Free software: Apache-2.0
* Documentation: <https://jeffallan.github.io/badfiles/>

## Introduction

At some point most applications need to accept files from a third party. Since we do not have absolute control over these files they present a serious threat vector.

The aim of this project is to provide a flexible and expandable solution to triage these files so they can be handled accordingly.

## Features

Currently, this project focuses on detecting the following:

### Generally Suspicious Files:

:heavy_check_mark: Mime type confusion.

:black_square_button: Files with a root UID or GID (*NIX only).

:black_square_button: Sticky, setuid, or setgit bit (*NIX only).

### CSV Files
:heavy_check_mark: CSV Injection.

:black_square_button: Files with a root UID or GID (*NIX only).

:black_square_button: Sticky, setuid, or setgit bit (*NIX only).

### Office Documents
:heavy_check_mark: DDE injection.

:heavy_check_mark: Files with a root UID or GID (*NIX only).

:heavy_check_mark: Sticky, setuid, or setgit bit (*NIX only).

### Zip Files
:heavy_check_mark: Symlink attacks.

:heavy_check_mark: Zip slips.

:heavy_check_mark: Nested zip bombs.

:heavy_check_mark: Flat zip bombs.

:heavy_check_mark: Sticky, setuid, or setgit bit (*NIX only).

:heavy_check_mark: Files with a root UID or GID (*NIX only).

### Tar Files
:heavy_check_mark: Files with a root UID or GID (*NIX only).

:heavy_check_mark: Sticky, setuid, or setgit bit (*NIX only).

:black_square_button: Files with absolute paths (*Nix only).



### Additional Features
Please file an issue or a pull request especially if you have found or created malicious files that bypass these detection mechanisms. Please see the [contributing guidelines](./contributing) for more details

## Credits

This package was created with [This Cookiecutter template.](https://github.com/zillionare/cookiecutter-pypackage)

This project uses [zip-bomb](https://github.com/damianrusinek/zip-bomb) to create the nested and flat zip bombs for unit testing and detection rules.

This project uses a custom Yara rule from [Reversing Labs](https://blog.reversinglabs.com/blog/cvs-dde-exploits-and-obfuscation) to detect obfuscated CSV injection payloads.
